Create simple and beautiful payment forms using Stripe and PayPal without any coding, including support for recurring payments

== Description ==
Create beautiful payment forms and accept PayPal, and all major credit cards supported by Stripe, like Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, JCB and Diners Club in your Wordpress site using PayForm. In one easy step you can insert a responsive payment form in your posts or pages, without needing any other plugin. You can accept normal payments (one type) or recurring payments (charge your customers’ credit card month by month automatically). All payments are safe and powered by Stripe subscriptions.

>**PayForm works out of the box in all Wordpress sites. You don’t need any other plugin or to have SSL in your server.**

PayForm is the simplest way to build a payment form in Wordpress and insert it anywhere. You can place the payment form in posts or pages. They are fully responsive and **works with any Wordpress theme**. Customize your form fields easily and have your payment form ready in a couple of minutes.

PayForm works with multiple gateways like PayPal and Stripe. Visit https://payform.me/pricing to know our plans, starting $19/mo.

Our plugin also supports recurring payments and memberships. You can choose the option that, when a customer pays, their credit card can be charged again recurringly in a monthly or yearly basis for the same amount automatically, similar to Netflix. This is perfect for club memberships or similar businesses that need recurrence in their payments.
